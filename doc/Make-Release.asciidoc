Maintainer instructions for making releases
===========================================

Introduction
------------

The point of this document is to describe all steps required to make a
proper release of the yubikey-personalization project.

Details
-------

* Make sure the doc/ sub-directory uses the latest revision.  Confirm with:
  cd doc && git checkout master && git pull && git diff

* Make sure the version number in configure.ac has been increment in AC_INIT.

* Make sure the libtool shared library version has been incremented properly, see http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Versioning.html Always increment LT_REVISION on every release -- it makes it possible to have multiple releases installed concurrently which helps testing.

* Make sure NEWS describes all changes since the last release.  Use https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-personalization/commits/master to review.

* Change the '(unreleased)' part in NEWS to '(released 20XX-YY-ZZ)' and commit that with a note 'Version Q.P'.

* Run 'make release'.

* Prepare Windows & Mac build -- see ykpers4win.mk and ykpers4mac.mk.

* Upload to Debian.

* Increment version number in configure.ac and add a NEWS template for the next release.
