It seems like the Linux kernel takes exclusive ownership over the
Yubikey, making it difficult for our programs to talk with it.
There's a workaround, though, to set a quirks mode for the key, as
follows:

  rmmod usbhid && modprobe usbhid quirks=0x1050:0x0010:0x04

In that mode, though, the Yubikey will not work as a keyboard and
therefore not generate any string at all, so to have it work as usual
again, you'll have to take usbhid out of quirks more:

  rmmod usbhid && modprobe usbhid
