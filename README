=Dependencies=

This package depends on another yubikey package called yubikey-core.

The current best way to get a working yubikey-core is to fetch it as
follows:

  svn checkout http://yubikey-core.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ yubikey-core

You can do that in a completely separate directory as well as directly
in the directory where you found this file.  If you do the former,
just make sure there's a soft link here with the name yubikey-core, as
follows:

  ln -s /PATH/TO/yubikey-core yubikey-core

Also, yubikey-core depends on the development files for libusb, so you
will have to get those as well.  Getting and installing them depends
on your operating systems, here are example for a few flavors:

  (Debian) apt-get install libusb-dev
  (Fedora) yum install libusb-devel
