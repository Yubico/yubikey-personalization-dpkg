= Yubikey Personalization =

The YubiKey Personalization package contains a library and command
line tool used to personalize (i.e., set a AES key) YubiKeys.

== Dependencies ==

Yubico-c-client is needed, see http://code.google.com/p/yubico-c/

Yubikey-personalization depends on libusb, so you will have to get it.
Getting and installing them depends on your operating systems, here
are example for a few flavors:

  (Debian) apt-get install libusb-dev
  (Fedora) yum install libusb-devel

== Building from SVN ==

Skip to the next section if you are using an official packaged
version.

You may check out the sources using SVN with the following command:

{{{
  svn checkout http://yubikey-personalization.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ yubikey-personalization
}}}

This will create a directory 'yubikey-personalization'.  Enter the directory:

{{{
  cd yubikey-personalization
}}}

Autoconf, automake and libtool must be installed.

Generate the build system using:

{{{
  autoreconf --install
}}}

== Building ==

You will need to have libyubikey (yubikey.h, libyubikey.so) and libusb
(usb.h, libusb.so) installed.  Get the libyubikey library from:

http://code.google.com/p/yubico-c/

The build system uses Autoconf, to set up the build system run:

{{{
  ./configure
}}}

Then build the code, run the self-test and install the binaries:

{{{
  make check install
}}}
