* Version 1.15.0 (released 2014-01-10)

** add new Neo version 3.2 as supported.

** let ykp_AES_key_from_password() return error if it can't get a random
salt.

** let -a without option mean ask for raw key on STDIN.

** let -m take challenge-response timeout and autoeject timeout
supplied with : beteen, so mode:cr-timeout:autoeject-timeout

the command line tool, now all 16 bytes can be set.

** Documentation updates and fixes.

* Version 1.11.0 (released 2012-12-12)

** Added version symbols and functions.
The header file is "ykpers-version.h" and it contains the following
symbols and functions: YKPERS_VERSION_STRING, YKPERS_VERSION_NUMBER,
YKPERS_VERSION_MAJOR, YKPERS_VERSION_MINOR, YKPERS_VERSION_PATCH,
ykpers_check_version.  Requested by Giampaolo Bellini
<iw2lsi@gmail.com>.

* Version 1.10.0 (released 2012-12-11)

** Support for the new productId of the production Neo.
Has ProducId 0x110, 0x111 or 0x112 depending on mode (see the notes about
-m and device_config).

** Add support for SLOT_NDEF2.
Use SLOT_NDEF to emit slot 1 as NDEF or SLOT_NDEF2 to emit slot 2.
This also adds the function yk_write_ndef2() that takes a slot parameter.

** Add -m flag for ykpersonalize, set usb mode of YubiKey NEO.
0 means pure YubiKey mode, 1 means pure CCID mode and 2 means YubiKey/CCID
composite mode. Add 80 to set EJECT_FLAG.
To use this with the api, see the functions:
ykp_alloc_device_config(), ykp_free_device_config(), ykp_set_device_mode(),
ykp_set_device_chalresp_timeout(), ykp_set_device_autoeject_time() and
yk_write_device_config().

** Add -S flag for ykpersonalize, set the scanmap of the YubiKey NEO.
Take an 90 character string describing 45 scancodes. See man page for more
info. To use this with the api see yk_write_scan_map().

** In the api add ykp_ndef_as_text() to export the text from a YK_NDEF structure.

** Higher timeout for configuration writes as in particular swap can take
longer than 600 ms.

** Memory leak fixes and potential crash fixes in osx backend.

** Error reporting fixes in osx backend, reporting correct errors and
better errors.

** Provide new another udev permissions file that works on udev version
greater than 188. Autodetects from configure which to use. Thanks to
Maxim Burgerhout <maxim@wzzrd.com>.

** Add new binary ykinfo, can be used to get serial number, version and
touch level from a YubiKey.

* Version 1.8.0 (released 2012-09-28)

** Added ./configure --enable-gcc-warnings to enable a lot of warnings.

** Added Continuous integration at travis-ci
(http://travis-ci.org/#!/Yubico/yubikey-personalization)

** Added yk_challenge_response() function for doing challenge response
with a key.

** Fixed functions for NDEF writing, adding:
ykp_ndef_alloc(), ykp_ndef_free() and ykp_set_ndef_access_code()
also providing compatible name YK_NDEF in ykcore.h and exporting
yk_write_ndef() there.
Change return values from ndef_construct_*() functions to make them
consistent with the rest of the library.

** Fixed a crash bug when the library was called from different threads.

** Check return code from libusb_init() so we avoid crashing there.
Also use a usb context instead of relying on default.

** Fix numerous warnings.

** Fix compilation in MSVC2010.

* Version 1.7.0 (released 2012-06-07)

** Add support for new features in YubiKey 2.3:

Update command (-u) to do update of existing config.
Swap command (-x) to swap contents of two updatable slots
DORMANT flag that's settable/removable if ALLOW_UPDATE is set
USE_NUMERIC_KEYPAD flag for sending the OATH OTP using keypad scan codes instead
FAST_TRIG flag for faster triggering of slot one if slot two is empty

** Change the library around some to make the 2.3 features available.
Use ykp_alloc() instead of ykp_create_config().
Use ykp_configure_version() instead of ykp_configure_for() to set the version.
Use ykp_configure_command() instead of ykp_configure_for() to set slot.
Use yk_write_command() instead of yk_write_config().

The new commands doesn't set any default configuration at all.

** Add library support for the YubiKey NEO beta
ykp_construct_ndef_uri() for preparing a URI to write.
ykp_construct_ndef_text() for preparing a text to write.
yk_write_ndef() to write the constructed NDEF.

incompatible API or ABI change in the future, it will be released as a
a new library libykpers-2 with header files in ykpers-2/.
