By Tollef Fog Heen <tfheen@err.no>.

* Version 0.96 (released 2009-08-27)

** Make all input numbers hex by default.
It's still possible to give modhex numbers by preceding them with
`m:'.

** Make it possible to program the second configuration.
Added the two flags -1 and -2 to ykpersonalize.  This is to support
the YubiKey II.

** Have ykpersonalize show the new configuration and prompt.
This makes it possible for the user to prevent incorrect configurations.

** Rename installed library to "libykpers-1" and place
** installed header files in sub-directory ykpers-1/.
From now on we promise to retain API and ABI under this name forever.
The shared library will be installed as /usr/lib/libykpers-1.so and
the header files into /usr/include/ykpers-1/.  If there is ever an
incompatible API or ABI change in the future, it will be released as a
a new library libykpers-2 with header files in ykpers-2/.

** Add pkg-config script "ykpers-1".
To learn which flags to build the applications that uses the library,
use "pkg-config --cflags --libs ykpers-1".
