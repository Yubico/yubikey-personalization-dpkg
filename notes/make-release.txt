== THIS NEEDS TO BE FILLED IN ==

In every release, the following steps need to be taken:

1.   Update the version information in the following files:

     - configure.ac	You MUST change the version number given to
			AC_INIT.

1.5. To make life simpler, you might want to start a shell and define
     a version variable as follows (change 'x.y' to the version number
     that you set in configure.ac):

     $ RELEASE=x.y

     If you don't do this, you will have to replace "$RELEASE" with
     the version number manually every time it's mentioned in the
     commands following.

2. Commit a revision with the changed files and a message noting what
   is done, as follows:

   $ svn ci -m "Release $RELEASE" configure.ac

3. Tag the release as follows:

   $ svn copy https://yubikey-personalization.googlecode.com/svn/trunk \
              https://yubikey-personalization.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-$RELEASE \
           -m "Tagging release $RELEASE of yubico-personalization."
