== NAME
ykchalresp - Perform challenge-response operation with YubiKey

== SYNOPSIS

*ykchalresp* [__-1__ | __-2__] [__-H__ | __-Y__] [__-N__] [__-x__] [__-v__] [__-6__ | __-8__] [__-t__] [__-V__] [__-h__]

== DESCRIPTION

Send a challenge to a YubiKey, and read the response.  The YubiKey can be configured
with two different C/R modes -- the standard one is a 160 bits HMAC-SHA1, and the other
is a YubiKey OTP mimicing mode, meaning two subsequent calls with the same challenge
will result in different responses.

== OPTIONS

*-1*:: send the challenge to slot 1.  This is the default

*−2*:: send the challenge to slot 2.

*-H*:: send a 64 byte HMAC challenge.  This is the default.

*-Y*:: send a 6 byte Yubico OTP challenge.

*-N*:: non-blocking mode -- abort if the YubiKey is configured
to require a key press before sending the response.

*-x*:: challenge is hex encoded.

*-v*:: enable verbose mode.

*-6*:: output the response in OATH format, 6 digits.

*-8*:: output the response in OATH format, 8 digits.

*-t*:: use current time as challenge instead of reading challenge from
command line (as in default TOTP mode, seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 
/ 30 encoded as an 8 byte challenge).

*-V*:: print tool version and exit.

== EXAMPLE

The YubiKey challenge-response operation can be demonstrated using the
*NIST PUB 198 A.2* test vector.

First, program a YubiKey with the test vector :

 $ ykpersonalize -2 -ochal-resp -ochal-hmac -ohmac-lt64 -a 303132333435363738393a3b3c3d3e3f40414243
  ...

 $

Now, send the NIST test challenge to the YubiKey and verify the result
matches the expected :

 $ ykchalresp -2 'Sample #2'
 0922d3405faa3d194f82a45830737d5cc6c75d24
 $
