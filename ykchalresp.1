.SH NAME
ykchalresp - Perform challenge-response operation with YubiKey
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ykchalresp
[\fI-1\fR | \fI-2\fR] [\fI-H\fR] [\fI-Y\fR] [\fI-N\fR] [\fI-x\fR] [\fI-v\fR] [\fI-h\fR]
.\".SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Send a challenge to a YubiKey, and read the response.  The YubiKey can be configured
with two different C/R modes -- the standard one is a 160 bits HMAC-SHA1, and the other
is a YubiKey OTP mimicing mode, meaning two subsequent calls with the same challenge
will result in different responses.
.TP
\fB\-1\fR
send the challenge to slot 1.  This is the default.
.TP
\fB\-2\fR
send the challenge to slot 2.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR
send a 64 byte HMAC challenge.  This is the default.
.TP
\fB\-Y\fR
send a 6 byte Yubico OTP challenge.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR
non-blocking mode -- abort if the YubiKey is configured to require a key press before
sending the response.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR
challenge is hex encoded.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
enable verbose mode.

.SH EXAMPLE
The YubiKey challenge-response operation can be demonstrated using the
\fBNIST PUB 198 A.2\fR test vector.
.P
First, program a YubiKey with the test vector :
.HP
.nf
$ \fBykpersonalize -2 -ochal-resp -ochal-hmac -ohmac-lt64 -a 303132333435363738393a3b3c3d3e3f40414243\fR
 ...
Commit? (y/n) [n]: y
$
.fi
.HP
Now, send the NIST test challenge to the YubiKey and verify the result matches the
expected :
.HP
.nf
$ \fBykchalresp -2 'Sample #2'\fR
